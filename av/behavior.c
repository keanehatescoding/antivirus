/*
 * behavior.c - v0.8.0: behavioral heuristics implementation.
 * See behavior.h for the design summary.
 *
 * v0.8.1: per-PID entries in behavior_table were never reclaimed on
 * process exit - fine for a demo session, a real leak on long uptime
 * (every process that ever did a write-intent open or an execve leaves
 * a permanent kzalloc'd entry). Fixed with a periodic GC sweep
 * (behavior_gc_fn) rather than hooking process exit directly: our key
 * is a tgid, and correctly detecting "the whole process is gone" from
 * an exit hook means reasoning about thread-group-leader-vs-last-
 * thread teardown timing, which is exactly the kind of version-
 * fragile kernel API area main.c's openat/write() comment already
 * avoids elsewhere. A sweep that checks liveness via
 * pid_task(find_vpid(pid), PIDTYPE_TGID) gets the same end state
 * (stale entries eventually reclaimed) without that fragility, and
 * reuses the same delayed_work idiom as everything else here.
 *
 * Later fix: the rapid-write/rename counters were a FIXED (discrete)
 * window despite being called "sliding" in comments/docs - the
 * counter reset to 0/1 whenever more than WINDOW_MS had elapsed since
 * the window started, with no memory of activity in the PREVIOUS
 * window. A process could write up to THRESHOLD files, pause just
 * past the window boundary, and repeat indefinitely without ever
 * tripping either heuristic, regardless of total volume over time -
 * documented as evasion finding #4 in docs/evasion-findings.md.
 * sliding_window_note() (below) replaces the reset-on-boundary logic
 * with a real trailing window: each ring slot now carries its own
 * jiffies timestamp, and the count checked against each threshold is
 * "how many distinct entries fall within the last WINDOW_MS as of
 * right now", continuously, not "how many since the window last
 * reset". There is no longer a boundary to pace around.
